## Description: 
Converts all common user inputs for dates into the mostly likely date object given that input.
## Dependencies: 
Java 19.0.1 JVM

## Instructions: 
Download the DateTest.jar file from out/artifacts/DateTest_jar/ and run it with the command java -jar DateTest.jar
The program will ask you to enter a date, and then will print out the date object it thinks you meant.
If you want to exit the program, enter "exit" as the date.
If you want to see the code, download the source code and open it in your favorite IDE.

## Troubleshooting:
If you are having trouble running the program, make sure you have the correct version of Java installed and that you have added it to your path.
